# How AI-native companies do model orchestration & token efficiency

A reviewed, cited snapshot of how the leading agentic-coding shops — **Anthropic, OpenAI,
Google, and Cursor** — actually divide work across model tiers and keep the token bill down,
plus the vendor-neutral patterns they converge on. It exists to ground this repo's
[`model-orchestration`](../skills/model-orchestration/SKILL.md) skill in evidence
rather than vibes.

## The big picture — what everyone agrees on

Despite different products, the four companies have converged on the same playbook:

1. **Start simple; escalate only when measured.** Begin with one well-prompted model; add
   workflows, multi-agent orchestration, or a bigger model only when evals show the simple
   thing falls short. Stated almost identically by Anthropic ("add complexity only when
   simpler solutions fall short") and OpenAI ("maximize a single agent first").
2. **Tier the model to the task.** A strong model plans, decomposes, and reviews; cheaper/
   faster models execute well-specified sub-tasks; you escalate on failure. Every vendor
   ships an explicit cheap tier (Haiku / mini-nano / Flash-Lite / Composer) for exactly this.
3. **One effort knob, not just model-switching.** Each now exposes a *reasoning-effort* /
   *thinking-level* dial so a single model can serve cheap and deep workloads — often a finer
   lever than swapping models.
4. **Context engineering is the token game.** Curate the smallest high-signal context;
   isolate verbose work in sub-agents that return summaries; cache the stable prefix;
   retrieve instead of stuffing. Token usage is the dominant cost *and* quality variable.
5. **Multi-agent is powerful but expensive** — reserve it for high-value, parallelizable work.

The rest of this doc is the evidence behind each.

## What changed since the June snapshot

As of July 2026, the underlying playbook above is unchanged — every vendor still tiers
models and exposes an effort dial. What moved is the concrete lineup and a couple of new
orchestration primitives:

- **Anthropic shipped a tier above Opus: Claude Fable 5** (`claude-fable-5`), generally
  available since June 9, 2026, with an invitation-only sibling **Claude Mythos 5** for
  Project Glasswing (defensive cybersecurity). Fable 5 runs **adaptive thinking always-on**
  and adds a fifth effort level, **`xhigh`** (between `high` and `max`), aimed at long-horizon
  agentic work with token budgets in the millions. Claude Code's effort menu also gained an
  **`ultracode`** mode that pairs `xhigh` with standing permission to launch multi-agent
  workflows. ([Models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) ·
  [Effort](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort))
- **Claude Code added Agent Teams**, an experimental (opt-in, disabled by default)
  orchestration primitive distinct from subagents: teammates get their own context window
  *and* message each other directly over a shared task list, rather than only reporting back
  to a lead. Anthropic's own guidance keeps the same escalation logic this doc already
  recommends — start with 3–5 teammates, prefer subagents for tasks that don't need
  inter-agent discussion, and expect materially higher token cost than a single session.
  ([Agent teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams))
- **OpenAI's reasoning-effort dial gained `none` and `xhigh`** (confirmed, not new relative to
  the June text, but now verified directly against current docs) as the model line moved to
  **GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.5**; `xhigh` targets "deep research and asynchronous workflows requiring
  very long reasoning," mirroring Anthropic's new top effort level. Codex also picked up
  **Codex Remote** (approve/monitor cloud runs from the ChatGPT mobile app), extending the
  "plan/verify locally, delegate long work to the cloud" split this doc already describes.
  ([Reasoning models](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning) ·
  [Codex changelog](https://developers.openai.com/codex/changelog))
- **Google folded Gemini CLI into the Go-based Antigravity CLI**; free/consumer-tier Gemini
  CLI and Gemini Code Assist IDE extensions stop serving requests **June 18, 2026** (paid
  Gemini Code Assist Standard/Enterprise licenses are unaffected). The Gemini model line also
  moved a generation, to **Gemini 3.1 Pro / Gemini 3 Flash / Gemini 3.5 Flash / Gemini 3.1
  Flash-Lite**, alongside a desktop **Antigravity 2.0** for multi-agent orchestration.
  ([Transitioning Gemini CLI to Antigravity CLI](https://developers.googleblog.com/an-important-update-transitioning-gemini-cli-to-antigravity-cli/) ·
  [Gemini API pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing))
- **Cursor shipped Composer 2.5**, trained on "25x more synthetic coding tasks" than Composer
  2 per Cursor's own post, with a cheaper "faster variant" alongside the standard tier; Auto
  and Composer now draw from a shared "Auto + Composer" usage pool distinct from third-party
  frontier models. ([Composer 2.5](https://cursor.com/blog/composer-2-5))

None of this changes the doc's routing advice — it's more evidence for the same pattern:
tier the model, tune effort before switching tiers, and reserve multi-agent fan-out
(subagents, Agent Teams, or Cursor's parallel-agent interface) for work that actually
fans out.

## Anthropic

**Tiering & orchestration.** Anthropic's *Building effective agents* essay is the canonical
taxonomy: it separates **workflows** ("LLMs and tools orchestrated through predefined code
paths") from **agents** ("LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage"), and
codifies five reusable patterns — **prompt chaining, routing, parallelization
(sectioning/voting), orchestrator-workers, and evaluator-optimizer**. Its routing example
*is* model-tiering: send easy/common inputs to a small cheap model and hard/unusual inputs to
a more capable one.

The flagship demonstration is Anthropic's own multi-agent **Research** system: a lead agent
plans and spawns **3–5 parallel sub-agents** that act as intelligent filters and return
condensed findings. Anthropic reports the lead-plus-subagents configuration "outperformed
single-agent Claude Opus 4 by **90.2%** on our internal research eval" — but also that
"agents typically use about **4×** more tokens than chat interactions, and multi-agent
systems use about **15×** more tokens than chats," with **token usage alone explaining ~80%**
of performance variance. The lesson the orchestration skill borrows: *orchestrate only when
the task value justifies a 15× token bill.*

The cheap tier is explicit. On the Haiku release: "Sonnet … can break down a complex problem
into multi-step plans, then orchestrate a team of multiple **Haiku**s to complete subtasks in
parallel." Docs list "sub-agent tasks" as a primary Haiku use case — the current model
selection matrix still names Haiku 4.5 for "sub-agent tasks" explicitly. Previously this doc
hedged that "the current top tier has moved beyond Opus 4.8 in the live model picker"; as of
July 2026 that tier has a name: **Claude Fable 5** (GA since June 9, 2026), a widely-released
tier above Opus, with an invitation-only **Claude Mythos 5** alongside it for defensive
cybersecurity workflows (Project Glasswing). Opus 4.8 remains the recommended starting point
for "complex agentic coding and enterprise work"; Fable 5 is for workloads that need the
highest available capability. Route by tier — *frontier / balanced / cheap* — and let
`/model` pick the concrete name.

**Token efficiency.** Three named levers:
- **Prompt caching** — "reducing costs by **up to 90%** and latency by **up to 85%** for long
  prompts"; cache reads bill at ~10% of base input.
- **Context engineering** — "find the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens," motivated
  by *context rot* (accuracy degrades as the window fills against a finite attention budget).
  For long horizons: **compaction**, **structured note-taking/memory**, and **sub-agent
  isolation**.
- **Effort tuning** — "tuning effort is often a better lever than switching models." As of
  July 2026 the dial has five levels (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`); `xhigh` is new
  since the June snapshot, aimed at "long-running agentic and coding tasks (over 30 minutes)
  with token budgets in the millions." `high` remains the default on every current model.

**Productized.** Claude Code **subagents** implement orchestrator-workers locally: each runs
in its own context window with a custom prompt, restricted tools, and a **configurable
model** (the `model` frontmatter field accepts `sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku`/`fable`/a full model
ID/`inherit`; the built-in `Explore` runs on Haiku, `Plan` inherits the main model);
forked subagents reuse the parent's prompt cache. As of July 2026, Claude Code also ships an
**experimental Agent Teams** mode for cases subagents don't cover — see
[What changed since the June snapshot](#what-changed-since-the-june-snapshot). The Claude
Agent SDK exposes the same loop for building these in code.

## OpenAI

**Tiering & orchestration.** OpenAI fields a frontier coding/reasoning model plus
progressively cheaper variants and **mini/nano** tiers explicitly "for tasks where speed and
cost matter most like classification, data extraction, ranking, and **sub-agents**." As of
July 2026 the frontier line is **GPT-5.5** (defaulting to `medium` reasoning effort), with
**GPT-5.4** the source of the cheaper **mini** and **nano** variants; OpenAI's own migration
guidance is to "begin migration with a fresh baseline instead of carrying over every
instruction from an older prompt stack" rather than assume drop-in compatibility across
generations. Its official model-selection method is **optimize-down**, confirmed verbatim in
current docs: "Optimize for accuracy first … then maintain accuracy with the cheapest,
fastest model possible." A single **`reasoning.effort`** control — confirmed values as of
July 2026: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` (model-dependent; check the
model page) — tunes thinking, and "**higher reasoning effort isn't automatically better**" —
high effort on weakly-specified tasks causes overthinking. A separate `text.verbosity` knob
trims output length independently.

The **Agents SDK** offers two orchestration shapes — a code-owned **Manager** (agents-as-
tools, the manager keeps the reply) and decentralized **Handoffs** (control transfers to a
specialist via `transfer_to_<agent>` tools) — with the standing advice to "**start with one
agent**." **Guardrails** run input/output checks with tripwires, designed to use a cheap fast
model to halt bad requests *before* the expensive agent runs.

**Codex** is the agentic-coding product across a local CLI, a parallel **cloud** environment,
and an IDE extension; the guidance is to "treat Codex like a teammate with explicit context
and a clear definition of 'done'" — plan/verify in the tight local loop, delegate long
implementations to background cloud tasks. New since June 2026: **Codex Remote** reached
general availability, letting you start, monitor, and approve a cloud run from the ChatGPT
mobile app — the same local-plan/cloud-delegate split, with the approval step no longer tied
to a desk.

**Token efficiency.** **Automatic prompt caching** gives "**up to 90%** cheaper cached input
tokens" with no cache-write fee (place static content first, variable content last, ≥1024-
token prefixes). The **Responses API** can persist reasoning across turns (chain via
`previous_response_id`) so chain-of-thought isn't re-billed and cache utilization improves.
Reasoning tokens are billed as (hidden) output tokens and discarded between turns by default.

## Google

**Tiering & orchestration.** Google tiers the **Gemini** family into **Pro** (deep reasoning/
agentic coding), **Flash** (fast, frontier-class), and **Flash-Lite** (budget high-volume),
with the cheap-vs-deep split visible in pricing (Flash-Lite output is several-fold cheaper
than Pro). As of July 2026 the generation has moved to **Gemini 3.1 Pro**, **Gemini 3 Flash**,
**Gemini 3.5 Flash**, and **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite** (the 2.5 generation is still listed and
priced, but no longer the newest); the tier split holds at the new generation too — 3.1
Flash-Lite input is roughly 8x cheaper than 3.1 Pro input. A unified **thinking-level**
control (low/medium/high; numeric `thinking_budget` still supported) trades reasoning depth
for cost, since thinking tokens bill as output. Google markets Flash as delivering "Pro-grade
reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost" — using materially fewer tokens than
the prior Pro on everyday tasks; per Google's own I/O 2026 claim, Gemini 3.5 Flash
"outperforms Gemini 3.1 Pro across almost all benchmarks while running four times faster."

Uniquely, Google ships a **managed cost router**: the **Vertex AI Model Optimizer** is "a
single meta-endpoint that auto-selects the best Gemini model per request" via a quality-vs-
cost preference (`PRIORITIZE_QUALITY` / `BALANCED` / `PRIORITIZE_COST`) — routing in the
platform instead of app code.

**Agentic coding** consolidated in 2026: **Gemini CLI** (open-source) is being folded into
the Go-based **Antigravity CLI** — previously stated as an in-progress move, now confirmed
with a firm date: free/consumer-tier Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist IDE extensions stopped
serving requests **June 18, 2026** (paid Gemini Code Assist Standard/Enterprise and
Gemini-Code-Assist-for-GitHub customers are unaffected). **Antigravity** is an agent-first
platform centered on parallel multi-agent orchestration, and gained a desktop **Antigravity
2.0** at I/O 2026 for the same purpose; **Jules** is an async coding agent that runs in an
isolated cloud VM, plans before acting, and returns reviewable GitHub PRs — as of I/O 2026 its
context window grew to 2M tokens and it now auto-fixes its own CI failures on a PR before
requesting review; the Gemini API's **Managed Agents** ("a single API call … spins up an agent
that reasons, uses tools and executes code in an isolated Linux environment") moved from
preview toward broader availability, running on Gemini 3.5 Flash inside an isolated,
OS-level-sandboxed Linux environment. The open-source **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** provides
sequential/parallel/loop/hierarchical (coordinator-dispatcher) orchestration and is
model-agnostic — assign cheap models to workers, a stronger one to the coordinator.

**Token efficiency.** The **1M-token context window** plus **context caching** is the
strategy: **implicit caching** is automatic (no storage fee) and **explicit caching** manages
reusable cache objects (hourly storage fee). Cached-input discounts are large; previously
stated as "on the order of 75% on the 2.5 generation, higher on newer ones" — confirmed
directionally correct as of July 2026: Gemini 3.5 Flash's cached input is **$0.15/MTok
against a $1.50/MTok standard rate, a 90% discount**, per Google's own pricing page. The
signature move: **load a whole repo once and cache it**, so every subsequent agent turn reads
context at the cached rate.

## Cursor (Anysphere)

**Tiering & orchestration.** Cursor's 2025–26 shift is notable: alongside orchestrating
third-party frontier models, it **trained its own** model family, **Composer** — a
mixture-of-experts model trained with reinforcement learning *inside the real Cursor agent
harness* (semantic search, grep, edit, terminal). Cursor reports (vendor self-report)
Composer generates **~4× faster** than similarly intelligent models, finishing most agent
turns under 30s. As of July 2026 the current release is **Composer 2.5**, trained on "25x
more synthetic coding tasks" than Composer 2 per Cursor's own post, aimed at more reliable
sustained work on long-running tasks; it ships alongside a cheaper "faster variant" at the
same intelligence level. Orchestration centers on an **"Auto"** router that "balance[s]
intelligence, cost efficiency, and reliability" for everyday tasks — billed from a cheaper
included-usage pool than named frontier models, a deliberate strong-vs-cheap tradeoff; Cursor
now names this pool **"Auto + Composer,"** split out from a separate "Third-Party API" pool
(Claude, GPT, Gemini) on Teams seats. **Plan Mode** separates planning from execution: the
agent researches, asks clarifying questions, and produces an editable plan you approve before
any code is written. **Cursor 2.0** added a multi-agent interface to run many agents in
parallel (git worktrees or remote VMs), including racing several models on one problem
(best-of-N).

**Token / context efficiency.**
- **Codebase indexing** — chunk code, embed it, store obfuscated vectors remotely, **re-embed
  only changed files** (Merkle-tree change detection); retrieve relevant chunks at query time
  instead of dumping the repo.
- **Scoped context** — `@`-mentions (`@Files`, `@Docs`, `@Branch`, …) and a **rules** system
  (`.cursor/rules`, user/team rules, `AGENTS.md`) with four application modes inject only
  relevant instructions; docs advise rules kept "under 500 lines … added only when the agent
  repeats a mistake."
- **Fast-apply / speculative edits** — a planner/applier split: the strong model emits a
  compact edit instruction; a cheaper fine-tuned model rewrites the file via deterministic
  speculative decoding at ~1000 tokens/sec.
- **Background/cloud agents** run in isolated remote VMs on their own branch, billed
  separately — offloading long work from the interactive session.

## The vendor-neutral pattern catalog

Convergent across Anthropic's essay, OpenAI's agents guide, LangGraph/LangChain, and the
[12-factor-agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) community:

### Orchestration patterns
| Pattern | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Router (model-tiering)** | Classify each task/step and dispatch to the cheapest model that can handle it; treat routing as a *per-step* decision | Mixed traffic with distinct difficulty bands |
| **Orchestrator-workers** | A strong lead decomposes an open-ended task and spawns workers (often cheaper), then synthesizes | Open-ended tasks whose sub-tasks you can't predict |
| **Evaluator-optimizer** | Generator LLM + evaluator LLM loop until criteria pass; evaluator can be cheaper | Clear eval criteria + iterative refinement pays |
| **LLM-as-judge** | A model with a fixed rubric scores/accepts outputs and gates escalation | Automated quality gate; deciding stop/retry/escalate |
| **Escalate-on-failure** | Run on a cheap tier first; on a failed verifier/test/schema check, retry one tier up | Capture cheap-execution savings, preserve strong-model success rate |

The community consensus (incl. practitioner reports and Simon Willison, who moved from
skeptic to "sold on multi-agent … where task value justifies cost") is blunt: **a single
agent with the right tools and context matches or beats multi-agent on most tasks**, and
multi-agent adds large latency/cost overhead. Orchestrate when the task **fans out into
independent, well-specified pieces** — not by default.

### Token-economy techniques
| Technique | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Prompt caching** of static prefixes | Up to ~90% input-cost / ~85% latency reduction on cached prefixes; compounds across agent loops |
| **Context compaction / summarization** | Bounds token growth over long horizons; avoids "lost in the middle" degradation |
| **Sub-agent context isolation** | Verbose work stays out of the main window; system processes more total info than one window holds |
| **Structured outputs (schema-constrained)** | Kills reparse/repair round-trips; makes routing/escalation machine-checkable |
| **Retrieval over context-stuffing** | Targeted context per turn → lower input cost *and* higher relevance/accuracy |
| **Effort/thinking-level tuning** | Cheaper than model-switching for the same model; cut reasoning tokens on easy work |
| **Write less code (YAGNI / minimalism)** | The cheapest tokens are never generated — the [`ponytail`](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) lever |

## What this means for `agentic-playbook`

The skill and this repo apply the above at config altitude, not as a runtime service:

- **Route by tier** — the [`model-orchestration`](../skills/model-orchestration/SKILL.md)
  skill encodes strong-plan / cheap-execute / escalate-on-failure, by *task shape* so it
  survives model renames.
- **Cache the prefix** — [`prompt-caching-playbook`](../skills/prompt-caching-playbook/SKILL.md)
  and a byte-budgeted always-on layer keep the stable prefix
  small and cacheable.
- **Isolate + structure hand-offs** — subagents for verbose work; [`answer-shapes`](../skills/answer-shapes/SKILL.md)
  for parseable plan→execute hand-offs.
- **Write less** — `ponytail` as the minimalism lever.
