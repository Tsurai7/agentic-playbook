name: model-orchestration
description: Route each sub-task to the cheapest model tier that can do it well, and delegate execution to subagents. Apply when planning a multi-step or token-expensive task, choosing between strong/mid/cheap models (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku), or deciding whether to spawn subagents. Plan and decide with a strong model; execute well-specified sub-tasks with a cheap one; escalate on failure. Skip for a single trivial step - orchestration has overhead. Prompt/cache token costs of an LLM system belong to prompt-caching-playbook.

# Model orchestration

Match **model tier to task weight**, the same way the tool-precedence gate matches tool
weight to task weight. A strong model earns its cost on judgement — planning, decomposition,
ambiguous design, review. A cheap model is faster and far cheaper on well-specified
mechanical work — applying an agreed edit, renaming, boilerplate, search. Spending a
frontier model on a one-line rename is waste; spending a cheap model on an architecture call
is a bug. Route deliberately.

This is a **decision policy**, not a framework. It costs nothing until it fires.

## Tiers (route by shape, not by brand)

Think in three tiers so the policy survives model renames. Today's mapping:

| Tier | Role | Claude | Use for |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| **Strong** | Plan / decide / review | Opus | Decomposition, ambiguous or high-blast-radius design, final review, hard debugging, judging another model's output |
| **Mid** | General execution | Sonnet | Most day-to-day coding, multi-file edits with a clear spec, focused debugging |
| **Cheap** | Bulk / mechanical | Haiku | Well-specified single-file edits, renames, boilerplate, formatting, extraction, search, summarizing a file, draft commit messages |

Other providers tier the same way (GPT-5 / mini / nano; Gemini Pro / Flash / Flash-Lite).
Route by the task's *shape*; let the harness or `/model` pick the concrete model.

## Effort before model-switch

Switching tier is not the only knob. Modern models expose a **reasoning-effort / thinking-level**
dial (Claude effort low→max; GPT-5 `reasoning.effort`; Gemini thinking level), and tuning it is
often a finer, cheaper lever than changing model:

- **Lower** effort (or `none`) for easy, well-specified, latency-sensitive work — it cuts billed
  reasoning tokens without dropping a tier.
- **Higher** effort only for genuinely hard reasoning; more is *not* automatically better — on a
  weakly-specified task high effort causes overthinking and wasted tokens.

So the ladder is **right effort → right tier → orchestration**: reach for the next lever only
when the cheaper one is exhausted.

> Measured caveat (Haiku × trivial/easy SWE tasks, n=3, 2026-06): the effort dial moved **neither
> correctness nor cost** on these tiers — `trivial` was identical low-vs-high to the dollar, and
> `easy` was noise-dominated (the bare and configured arms disagreed on the *sign* of the effect).
> Effort bites on **reasoning-bound** work; where a weak model's cost is dominated by **tool turns**
> (the `easy` configured arm ran 10–12 turns vs 5–6 bare), gate the *tools* — right-size the
> tooling — not the thinking.

## The default pattern: plan strong, execute cheap, escalate on failure

These three steps are a **Thinker → Worker → Verifier** division of labor — the same role taxonomy
Sakana's Fugu / TRINITY router routes over
per turn (a learned policy emits a role *and* a model each step). Reserve the strong tier for the
**Thinker** step; a cheap tier handles **Worker** (execute) and **Verifier** (check).

1. **Plan with the strong tier.** Decompose the task into sub-tasks each small enough to
   hand off with an unambiguous spec: the file(s), the exact change, and a verifiable
   success check. A vague hand-off ("make it work") forces the executor to re-plan and
   burns the savings — a precise one (a written diff intent + the command that proves it)
   lets a cheap model finish independently. Pair this with `answer-shapes` so hand-offs are
   parseable.
2. **Execute with the cheapest capable tier.** Delegate each well-specified sub-task to a
   subagent (the `Agent`/Task tool, or a cheaper `/model`). Subagents also **isolate
   context** — the executor's intermediate reads never enter the planner's window, which is
   itself a large token saving on long tasks. If your config ships subagent roles (e.g.
   `implementer`/`doc-writer`/`verifier`/`researcher`), delegate to them instead of
   hand-authoring the boilerplate.
3. **Verify, then escalate only on failure.** Check the result (`verification-before-completion`).
   If a cheap tier fails the check twice, escalate that sub-task one tier up — do not loop a
   weak model on a problem above its weight. Escalation is the exception, not the plan.

## Delegation protocol (when the roles are installed)

When your config ships these four subagent roles (e.g. rendered to `~/.claude/agents/`),
each carries a pinned tier and a body with the scope guard, AC discipline,
status protocol, and environment notes — so a delegation prompt only needs the task:

| Role | Tier | Hand it |
|------|------|---------|
| `implementer` | mid | a plan file with hard AC (code changes) |
| `doc-writer` | cheap | an explicit item list (mechanical docs) |
| `verifier` | mid | an AC list + gate commands (read-only check) |
| `researcher` | mid + web | a question or doc to refresh, citations required |

These delegation mechanics were proven out in two live multi-agent delegation waves (June–July 2026):

1. **Plan files, not chat specs.** Each delegation gets a written plan with hard
   acceptance criteria and an explicit file scope; plans in the same wave never share
   files, so agents can run in parallel without conflicts.
2. **AC is the definition of done.** An agent that cannot meet an AC stops and reports
   the blocker; it does not improvise around it.
3. **Verify per wave.** The orchestrator (or the `verifier` role) runs the repo gates
   after each wave, before the next starts.
4. **Expect deaths.** Agents die mid-run (API errors); relaunch with a precise
   done/remaining map derived from the working tree, not from memory.
5. **Diff-check cheap-tier claims.** Reports from the cheap tier get compared against
   the actual diff before acceptance — measured failure mode: overstated docs claims.
6. **Statuses are structured.** `DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT`,
   with per-AC evidence, so the orchestrator parses instead of re-reading transcripts.

Claims discipline: the roles mechanize delegation; any token-savings number is a
hypothesis until a side-by-side measurement lands.

## When NOT to orchestrate

Orchestration has real overhead — a planning round, hand-off tokens, subagent spin-up.
A single capable model in one context often wins. **Stay single-model when:**

- The whole task is one or two steps, or fits comfortably in one context.
- The work is exploratory/ambiguous throughout (no stable spec to hand off) — keep it with
  the strong tier rather than thrashing a cheap one.
- Splitting would duplicate context across agents that all need the same large file set.
- **The task value can't justify the overhead.** A single agent can use ~4× the tokens of a
  chat and a multi-agent run ~15× — reserve fan-out for high-value, parallelizable tasks, not
  routine edits (figures: Anthropic's multi-agent research system write-up).

Rule of thumb: orchestrate when the task **fans out into independent, well-specified
pieces**. If you can't write the sub-task spec in two sentences, it isn't ready to delegate.

## Token economy (independent of tiering)

These cut the bill whatever model you are on — apply them first; they often remove the need
to orchestrate at all:

- **Cache the stable prefix.** Keep instructions/system/context order stable so the prompt
  cache hits. See `prompt-caching-playbook`.
- **Isolate context in subagents.** Hand a subagent only what its sub-task needs; return a
  short structured result, not the transcript.
- **Retrieve, don't stuff.** Pull the relevant code via structural/search tooling
  (AST-aware search, code-graph navigation) instead of pasting whole files into context.
- **Structured hand-offs.** `answer-shapes` skeletons make a cheap model's output complete
  and an orchestrator's parsing trivial — fewer correction round-trips.
- **Write less code.** The cheapest tokens are the ones never generated — enforce a
  do-less decision ladder before implementing.

## Composes with

| Pair with | For |
|-----------|-----|
| `answer-shapes` | Parseable plan → execute hand-offs |
| `prompt-caching-playbook` | Keeping the cache warm across the orchestration |
| `verification-before-completion` | The gate that decides escalate-or-done |

## Anti-patterns

- Spawning subagents for a task that fits in one context (overhead > savings).
- Delegating an under-specified sub-task, then paying to re-plan it.
- Looping a cheap model on a problem above its tier instead of escalating once.
- Using a frontier model for bulk mechanical edits a cheap tier would nail.
- Splitting a task so finely that every subagent re-reads the same large files.
